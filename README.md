## Concept
ShowerTime aims to raise awareness of your water consumption and motivate you to take shorter showers, educating the user about why saving water is important and how to do it effectively. It also adds a fun twist to your shower routine by showing you some interesting facts and trivia.

## How it works
ShowerTime has three main features: a timer, some statistics a learn section.

- **Timer**: When you start your shower, you can set a timer for how long you want to shower. The app will show you some stats about the amount of water you are using and how much you are saving compared to the average shower. When the timer is up, the app will sound an alarm and send you a notification to end your shower. You can use the timer every day to track your progress and see how much water you are saving over time.
- **Statistics**: The more you use the app, the more you'll learn about your water usage thanks to a dedicated section showing your personal water-usage statistics. ShowerTime uses gamification to make saving water more fun and rewarding. 
- **Learn**: The app also has a learn section where you can discover some facts and trivia about water-saving and the environment. You can learn something new every day.
